What Our Program Does:

    Our program asks for two user inputs: a first name and a last name. The program then prints their full name.

How to use our program:

    * Installation: There is no need for users to configure their system or move any files.
    
    * How to Actually Use it: Simply open the SkillsLab6Python.ipynb and run the code cell. Type in your first name. And then type in your last name.

    Example Usage: 
    
    ```python
    name = str(input("what is your first name?"))
    lastName = str(input("what is your last name?"))
    print("Your full name is: " + name + " " + lastName)
    ```
    what is your first name? Leo
    what is your last name? Tuckey
    Your full name is: Leo Tuckey
